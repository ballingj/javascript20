This project teaches animation on scroll.  The webpage is a template downloaded from Creative Tim.  The styling is done by Tailwind CSS, which I find very distasteful.  I don't think I will pursue tailwind CSS anytime soon.

We've also used some pictures from unsplash and random user photos to fill out fake team members
